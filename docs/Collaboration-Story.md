## Timeline

### 2017: The Beginning

**First Contact & Joint Research**

The collaboration began when both researchers identified a shared interest in the emerging field of cryptocurrency markets. At a time when academic research on digital assets was nascent, they recognized the opportunity to apply rigorous statistical methods to this new asset class.

**Milestone Publications:**
- "A Statistical Analysis of Cryptocurrencies" - *Journal of Risk and Financial Management*
  - First comprehensive statistical characterization of major cryptocurrencies
  - **179 citations** - became a foundational reference

- "GARCH Modelling of Cryptocurrencies" - *Journal of Risk and Financial Management*
  - Adapted traditional volatility models for crypto markets
  - **329 citations** - the most cited work in their collaboration

These early papers established the methodological framework that would guide subsequent research and attracted collaborators from around the world.

### 2024: Expanding Frontiers

**Multiple Research Streams**

The collaboration reached new maturity with simultaneous work across multiple domains:

**Publications:**
1. "Enhancing Security in Blockchain Networks: Anomalies, Frauds, and Advanced Detection Techniques"
   - Expanded the security research program
   - Added Prof. Branka Hadji Misheva to the team

2. "Stylized facts of metaverse non-fungible tokens"
   - Published in *Physica A: Statistical Mechanics*
   - Extended methodology to NFT markets

3. "Metaverse Non Fungible Tokens"
   - Comprehensive analysis of metaverse economics
   - Working paper for further development
