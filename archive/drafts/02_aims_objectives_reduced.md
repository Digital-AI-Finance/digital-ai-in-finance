# Project Aims and Objectives

The primary aim is to conduct a three-day academic workshop that disseminates research findings, facilitates knowledge exchange, and strengthens the **AUS-FHGR bilateral collaboration** in **AI applications for digital finance**. The workshop serves as the primary venue for sharing **15-20 research papers**, engaging **80-100 participants** from academia and industry, and advancing the field through comprehensive knowledge transfer. An additional outcome is formalizing the collaboration framework through a bilateral research agreement.

**Core Objectives.** The workshop pursues five core objectives that collectively advance the field while building lasting infrastructure. The first objective is to disseminate research and best practices by communicating AI finance research to **80-100 participants** from academia and industry through **15-20 paper presentations**, open-access proceedings, and an online resource repository, thereby advancing field knowledge by sharing Swiss precision banking expertise and MENA innovation insights while reaching a global audience through hybrid format. The second objective bridges the academia-industry gap by facilitating dialogue between researchers and practitioners on AI implementation, delivering industry case studies from **DIFC**, **Emirates NBD**, and **First Abu Dhabi Bank**, conducting roundtables, and producing a white paper with recommendations, ensuring academic research addresses real-world needs while practitioners gain evidence-based AI adoption insights.

The third objective builds research capacity by enhancing AI finance research capabilities through training and mentorship, offering a doctoral workshop for **20+ researchers**, establishing mentorship pairings, and creating best practice guidelines that develop next-generation researchers with skills and networks for international collaboration. The fourth objective formalizes the **AUS-FHGR collaboration** through signing a bilateral research agreement that establishes a framework for continued researcher mobility, joint supervision, and coordinated funding applications. The fifth objective catalyzes future collaborations by generating partnership opportunities through forming **4 thematic working groups** and initiating **3-5 joint research proposals** through workshop connections, ensuring long-term return on CCG investment.

**Communication Strategy.** The workshop targets three distinct audiences with tailored approaches. Academic researchers, comprising **60% of participants**, receive paper presentations, methodological workshops, proceedings, and collaboration opportunities. Industry practitioners, making up **40% of attendees**, benefit from executive keynotes, case studies, roundtables, and research partnerships. Policy makers access white papers on regulatory frameworks, AI governance panels, and policy recommendations. Dissemination occurs through multiple channels: immediate channels include live presentations to **80-100 participants**, hybrid streaming, social media, and press releases; short-term channels encompass open-access proceedings, white paper distribution, workshop reports, and follow-up webinars; long-term channels feature journal special issues, policy briefs, and implementation reports.

**Alignment with CCG Objectives.** This initiative directly addresses CCG's mission across four dimensions. For visibility, multiple dissemination channels amplify Swiss research excellence in MENA markets, positioning Switzerland as an AI finance innovation partner. For accessibility, the hybrid format and open publications ensure broad access, democratizing knowledge sharing regardless of geographic or financial constraints. For societal relevance, practical AI applications address pressing challenges in financial inclusion, fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance, contributing to economic stability and consumer protection. For sustainability, the bilateral collaboration framework creates lasting infrastructure, multiplying CCG's investment impact through continuous activities rather than one-time exchange.

**Success Metrics.** Success will be measured through both quantitative and qualitative indicators. Quantitative metrics include **80-100 participants** engaged, **AUS-FHGR bilateral agreement signed**, **15-20 papers** published in workshop proceedings, **4 working groups** established, and **3-5 joint research proposals initiated** through workshop collaborations. Qualitative indicators encompass **greater than 80% satisfaction** ratings measured through post-event surveys, new collaborations tracked through follow-up assessments, media coverage in academic and financial press, policy influence through white paper citations, and active collaboration activities post-workshop. The **72% co-funding rate** (**CHF 13,000** from partners versus **CHF 5,000** from CCG) demonstrates exceptional stakeholder commitment to achieving these objectives.
