# Timeline and Feasibility

The project implements over **15 months** from **December 2024** to **July 2026**, organized in three phases ensuring systematic preparation, professional execution, and sustainable outcomes.

**Phase 1: Pre-Workshop (Dec 2024 - Mar 2026).** Preparation begins with CCG application, committee formation, and website development (Dec 2024-Feb 2025). Following expected CCG approval in **February 2025**, the call for papers is issued and speaker invitations commence. March through August 2025 encompasses marketing campaigns, paper submissions, and registration opening. September through October 2025 involves paper review, acceptance notifications, and program finalization. November 2025 through January 2026 addresses speaker confirmations, venue planning, and technical setup. February through March 2026 completes materials preparation, bilateral agreement drafting, and final logistics. Critical milestone: **all speakers confirmed by March 2026**.

**Phase 2: Workshop (April 2026).** April 1-14: final preparations, technical testing, registration push. Workshop runs **April 21-23** with **Day 1** on research frontiers, **Day 2** on industry applications, and **Day 3** featuring training, working groups, and **AUS-FHGR agreement signing**. Key milestones: **80+ participants registered**, bilateral agreement signed.

**Phase 3: Post-Workshop (May - July 2026).** May: feedback collection, impact assessment, proceedings compilation. June: CCG reporting, proceedings publication, media documentation. July: collaboration platform launch, working group activation, proposal initiation. Milestones: proceedings published, **workshop report submitted** to CCG.

**Key Milestones.** **February 2025:** CCG approval. **March 2026:** Speakers confirmed. **April 15, 2026:** **80+ participants registered**. **April 21-23:** **Workshop delivered**, **15-20 papers presented**. **April 23:** AUS-FHGR agreement signed. **June 2026:** **Proceedings published**. **July 2026:** Report to CCG.

**Feasibility.** Proven **7-year collaboration** with **4 publications** and grants demonstrates execution capability. Institutional commitment letters with dedicated resources from **FHGR** and **AUS** ensure support. **72% co-funding (CHF 13,000)** demonstrates genuine investment. Established networks through FHGR Swiss academic/fintech contacts, AUS MENA partnerships, and **DIFC** connections provide participant pools. **AUS conference facilities** offer professional infrastructure.

**Risk Mitigation.** Low participation: partner commitments of **10 participants minimum**, registration tracking, virtual expansion. Speaker cancellations: early **March confirmations**, backup speakers, virtual capability. Technical failures: professional streaming, extensive testing, recording backup. Budget constraints: conservative planning, **10% contingency**, scalable elements, co-funding buffer.

**Resources.** Human: **82 hours** from leads (**32 FHGR**, **50 AUS**), committee contributions, AUS event management, technical team. Financial: **CHF 18,000 total** - **CHF 5,000 CCG** (**CHF 2,640** travel, **CHF 2,360** event costs), **CHF 11,100 AUS** (**CHF 10,500** in-kind, **CHF 600** cash), **CHF 2,500 FHGR** (in-kind).

**Sustainability.** Working groups continue with monthly meetings. Collaboration platform provides permanent infrastructure. **2027 workshop** planned for Switzerland. **AUS-FHGR agreement** formalizes framework. Joint proposals ensure continuity. Comprehensive timeline with clear milestones, feasibility justification, and risk mitigation ensures successful delivery and lasting impact.
