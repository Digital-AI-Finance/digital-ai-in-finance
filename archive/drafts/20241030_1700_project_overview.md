## AI for Digital Finance: Launching a Swiss-MENA Research Network Through Knowledge Exchange

### Activity Type
Three-day international workshop at the American University of Sharjah (AUS), UAE, April 21-23, 2026

### Disciplines
Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence, Finance/Economics, Mathematics/Statistics

### Context and Background
This workshop builds upon a successful 7-year research collaboration between Prof. Joerg Osterrieder (FHGR, Switzerland) and Prof. Stephen Chan (AUS, UAE), which has yielded four significant publications on blockchain security, fraud detection, and digital assets in virtual environments. The collaboration has established a robust foundation for Swiss-MENA research exchange and demonstrated the complementary strengths of both regions: Swiss precision in financial technology and regulatory frameworks, combined with the UAE's rapidly evolving digital finance ecosystem and innovation-friendly environment.

The workshop responds to the urgent need for interdisciplinary dialogue on AI applications in digital finance, particularly as both Switzerland and the UAE position themselves as global financial centers embracing technological transformation. The event will serve as the launching platform for a formal Swiss-MENA AI Finance Research Network, creating sustainable collaboration pathways between academic institutions, financial industry leaders, and regulatory bodies.

### Topics and Content
The workshop focuses on three critical areas where AI is transforming digital finance:

1. **Large Language Models (LLMs) in Finance**: Exploring applications of advanced language models for financial analysis, risk assessment, automated reporting, and customer service. Sessions will examine practical implementations while addressing challenges of model interpretability and regulatory compliance.

2. **Explainable AI for Regulatory Compliance**: Developing transparent, interpretable AI systems that meet stringent financial regulations. This theme addresses the critical need for AI models that can be audited and understood by regulators, particularly relevant for both FINMA requirements and UAE's regulatory sandbox approaches.

3. **Machine Learning for Fraud Detection**: Building on the principal investigators' published research, sessions will cover advanced ML techniques for identifying fraudulent activities in digital transactions, blockchain networks, and emerging financial technologies.

The three-day structure maximizes knowledge exchange:
- Day 1: Academic presentations showcasing latest research from Swiss and MENA institutions
- Day 2: Industry applications featuring case studies from DIFC/ADGM financial centers, Emirates NBD, and First Abu Dhabi Bank
- Day 3: Doctoral training workshops and network building sessions, incorporating MSCA Industrial Doctoral Network participants

### Target Audience
The workshop targets 80-100 participants with a strategic mix:
- 60% Academic researchers from Swiss and MENA universities specializing in AI, finance, and data science
- 40% Industry professionals from banks, fintech companies, and financial regulatory bodies
- Special emphasis on engaging UAE's financial free zones (DIFC, ADGM) and leading banks
- Integration of early-career researchers through MSCA Doctoral Network participation

This composition ensures meaningful dialogue between research and practice, facilitating knowledge transfer and identifying real-world challenges for academic investigation.

### Expected Outputs and Impact
The workshop will produce four tangible deliverables:

1. **Workshop Proceedings**: Open-access publication featuring presented papers and extended abstracts, disseminated through institutional repositories
2. **White Paper**: Collaborative position paper on AI adoption in Swiss-MENA financial sectors, targeting policymakers and industry leaders
3. **Research Agenda**: Five-year roadmap for Swiss-MENA collaboration in AI finance, identifying priority research areas and funding opportunities
4. **Online Repository**: Digital platform hosting presentations, video recordings, and resources for continued engagement

### Strategic Significance
This workshop strategically positions Swiss-MENA collaboration at the forefront of AI-driven financial innovation. Both regions share complementary strengths: Switzerland's established financial expertise and robust regulatory frameworks complement the UAE's dynamic market growth and openness to financial technology innovation. The workshop will establish formal collaboration mechanisms, creating pathways for bilateral research programs between Switzerland and the UAE.

The timing is optimal, as both regions are actively developing AI strategies for their financial sectors. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and UAE regulatory bodies are establishing frameworks for AI governance, making academic-industry dialogue crucial for informed policymaking.

### Sustainability and Future Collaboration
The workshop initiates a sustainable collaboration framework extending beyond the event itself. The established network will pursue Swiss-UAE bilateral research funding opportunities, with the workshop serving as proof-of-concept for larger collaborative initiatives. The combination of academic excellence, industry relevance, and regulatory engagement ensures lasting impact on both research advancement and practical implementation of AI in digital finance.

By bridging Swiss precision and MENA market dynamics, this workshop catalyzes innovation in AI applications for finance while fostering long-term research partnerships that benefit both regions' economic and technological development.
