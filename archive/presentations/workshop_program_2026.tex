% Welcome Message
\section*{Welcome Message}

Dear Colleagues and Partners,

It is our great pleasure to welcome you to this landmark workshop on AI for Digital Finance, marking the official launch of the Swiss-MENA AI Finance Research Network.

This three-day event represents the culmination of extensive collaboration between our institutions and the beginning of an exciting new chapter in international research partnership. The workshop brings together leading academics, industry practitioners, and policy makers to explore how artificial intelligence is transforming financial services and to establish collaborative frameworks for addressing shared challenges.

The program has been carefully designed to maximize knowledge exchange and partnership formation. Day 1 focuses on research foundations, showcasing the latest academic advances in AI applications for finance. Day 2 bridges to practical implementation, featuring industry case studies and real-world applications. Day 3 looks to the future, with doctoral training, working group formation, and the formal network launch through our MoU signing ceremony.

We are particularly grateful to the Leading House MENA for their support through the Connect \& Collaborate Grant, which has made this workshop possible. We also thank our institutional partners, industry sponsors, and all participants who have committed their time and expertise to this initiative.

We encourage you to actively engage throughout the workshop - attend sessions, ask questions, share insights, and most importantly, build connections that will drive future collaboration. The success of our network depends on the relationships formed and strengthened during these three days.

Welcome to Sharjah, welcome to AUS, and welcome to the Swiss-MENA AI Finance Research Network!
